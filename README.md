# Welcome to Sphere In Arms!

Sphere In Arms is a simple implementation of 3D FPS multiplayer game using Unity and Photon created as a group semester project. 


## Character Design
The character is the central part of the game that is designed simply. We have just used a capsule as our leading player to bring closer to what our name suggests, “Sphere In Arms”.

## Map Design
The map is entirely built in Unity ProBuilder, ProBuilder is a unique hybrid of 3D modeling and level design tools, optimized for building simple geometry but capable of detailed editing and UV unwrapping too

## Weapon Design
We had anticipated adding various types of guns to the game. So, a weapon loadout has been implemented, and for now, we have implemented only two types of guns: an assault rifle and a pistol. But we’ve implemented the menu to instantiate more guns in the future, which can be added and used in our loadout.
